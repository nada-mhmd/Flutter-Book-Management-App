# Library Management System in Flutter

This is my first Flutter project, developed as part of an assignment for the Mobile Computing course. It is a simple Library Management System that allows users to manage a collection of books.

## Features
- Add books by entering the book name and selecting a genre from a dropdown list.
- View added books in a list view with a dynamic counter showing the total number of books.
- Navigate to a details page to view the book's name and genre.
- Delete books either by long-pressing their item or by clicking the basket icon.
- The app ensures no duplicate book names are added.
- The book counter updates automatically whenever books are added or deleted.
